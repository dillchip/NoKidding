NoKidding (for SqueezeBox Radio)
2011-
===============================================================================

What: configuration files/patches for Logitech SqueezeBox Radio,
      for usage in an environment for kids.
Author: Svante Hermansson, http://dillchip.com
===============================================================================

Features:
- Restrict volume on front panel (0-40)
===============================================================================

Details:
These are some personal configurations to SqueezeBox Radio to make it suitable
for keeping in the kids room. The idea is to lock-down features that should not
be enabled on the unit's front panel. For full control, a remote control or the
web interface can still be used.

The changes are hacks in the somewhat poorly documented platform in the
SqueezeBox.
 - No warranty is given for the changes. 
 - Apply them at your own risk.
That said, I guess the risk is very low, and you should always be able to reset
your device to factory settings if needed.
===============================================================================

Some step by step instructions to apply the patch for volume restriction:
# make sure you have a SqueezeBox Radio
# make sure you have the IP number of your Radio unit
# make sure you have ssh enabled on your Radio unit

# download to some working directory:
...

# enter nokidding directory:
cd nokidding

# create working directories:
mkdir original updated

#fetch original configuration file, default password is '1234':
scp root@<<REPLACE_WITH_IP>>:/usr/share/jive/jive/slim/Player.lua original

#check version via md5sum hash:
md5sum original/Player.lua 
#expected output: de116e4d938b24fc061003305e558af5  original/Player.lua
#verify hash code, only continue and apply patch if same version as above!

#make a copy to use for the patch
cp original/Player.lua updated/

# now apply patch
patch updated/Player.lua < patches/Player.lua_patch_de116e4d938b24fc061003305e558af5

# copy the updated file to your SqueezeBox Radio
scp updated/Player.lua root@<<REPLACE_WITH_IP>>:/usr/share/jive/jive/slim/
